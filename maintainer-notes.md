## Notes

### Helpful Commands

These commands are less frequently used, but good to remember:

```bash
# Add shared dev dependency for workspace
yarn add --dev -W package-name
```

## TODO

- Patch status for PRs (we care about threshold only)
  - Allows us to use multiproject test runner
- Flags per project for merged coverage; easier to break down coverage per project
- Remove all-contributors bot; install CLI per project and add per project commands
-
